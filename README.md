# Mail Client Simulation

> web app simulating a mail client, running entirely on client side


A simple web app built with the Vue.js framework, using webpack and the vue-cli for the build step.
It was created for practice and is based on a tutorial from a Udemy learning course.

You can compose or read emails, check for new messages, mark messages as important, read or unread, delete them - and more.
This functionality is implemented using Vue components and the data methods provided by Vue.js, ie. an "eventBus" Vue instance.
